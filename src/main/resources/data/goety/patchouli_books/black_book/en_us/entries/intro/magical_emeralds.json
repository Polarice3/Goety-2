By putting an Emerald in a Cursed Infuser, it seems to 'activate' it, allowing it to release lots of magical energy.

The amount depends on which creature is slain, but considering the Illagers disposition towards the Villagers, it's not hard to figure out which creature has the most amount of Soul Energy."
