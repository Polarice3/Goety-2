When injured, you will use up the Soul Energy within your Totem to heal up all injuries (unless you're on fire)."

Necrotic Totems also cast their beneficial magic on you as well!"

Perhaps it is the power of Soul Energy that causes the potions to react the same way, as Ghasts, who are found in Soul Sand Valleys, and Vexes, made using Soul Energy, have the same properties."

However, should the number of Soul Energy be less that the usual number needed to revive you, you will be inflicted with a terrible Soul Hunger. The hunger will cause you to be weaker and slower, until your Soul Energy has reached the proper amount."
