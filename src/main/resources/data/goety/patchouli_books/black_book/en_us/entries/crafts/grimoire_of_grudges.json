The grimoire can record multiple beings, ranging from Villagers to even beings like you! That's not all, if your grudge extends towards species, hitting the being while crouching will cause the being's species be recorded! For example, crouching and hitting a Villager with the grimoire will make all your servants hostile towards ALL Villagers."
