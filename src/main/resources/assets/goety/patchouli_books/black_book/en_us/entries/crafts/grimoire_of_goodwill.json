The grimoire can record multiple beings, ranging from Pillagers to even beings like you! You can also prevent servants from attack entire species, as hitting a being while crouching will cause the being's species be recorded. For example, crouching and hitting a Pillager with the grimoire will cause your servants to no longer attack all Pillagers, even if they're pelting you with arrows."
