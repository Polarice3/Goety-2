The Fungus is a ball full of toxins that one can't help but throw upwards in the air. When hitting something, they will explode, with a chance of leaving behind a small cloud of poison. Curiously, the explosion does not effect the thrower nor their servants."

You've also discovered a way to increase the potency of the fungi by combining 4 of them with a Ghast Tear. These Blast Fungi's explosions have larger radius but they no longer leave any poison clouds."
