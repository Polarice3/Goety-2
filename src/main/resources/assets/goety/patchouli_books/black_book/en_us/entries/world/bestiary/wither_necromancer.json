Unfortunately, when the Blazes turned against their masters, turning the living inhabitants into charred withered remains, the necromancers, for all their power, were put down through either numbers and aid from what were referred to as 'Wildfires'... and perhaps even from the Piglins."

Their flaming pillars that either surrounds them or their target burn even on fire-resistant foes, and they would frequently summon Wither Skeletons to aid it. Fortunately for you and other dark wizards, these necromancers still held upon their, admittedly decayed and withered, manuscripts that holds some knowledge of their magical practices."
