The conversion, however, is not instantaneous. The Villager is turned into, what it's called, Ravaged, and will need to consume large amount of flesh before it can transition into a full Ravager."

Unsurprisingly, Villagers provide the most amount of flesh than any other. Once the Ravaged has transformed, it would need a specialized saddle that will make it not only rideable, but also stronger."
