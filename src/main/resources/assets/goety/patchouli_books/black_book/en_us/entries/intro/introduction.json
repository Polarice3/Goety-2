The act of summoning creatures to do one's bidding can be seen as a Dark Arts, for example. After all, most summonings you've encountered are done by foul forces."

With some scraps of knowledge you have an idea on accessing that those Spawners may be one of the keys to access these foul magics, or if they're too hard to find, some other way."
