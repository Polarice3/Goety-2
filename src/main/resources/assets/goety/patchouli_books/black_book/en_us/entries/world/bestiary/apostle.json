Some Apostles used to be Kings, Lords or Nobles, while others range from normal Villagers to the most ill-witted Nitwits. When the Emissary appears, the water around them boils, and the sky darkens."

They would shoot arrows upon them, while occasionally shooting a Lavaball or summoning the Undead to defend themselves.

When fought in the Overworld or dimensions similar to it, a storm will rain upon the world once they reveal themselves in their horrid form. Meteors will fall around them and the true battle begins. The Apostle will try to teleport more often, and they will begin to summon Zombified Piglin Brutes to do their bidding instead."

If their target was close to them, the Apostle will summon a circle of fire that after a short time, burst causing whatever creature near them to be knocked into the sky. The bursts and the flaming tornado curses the target with Burn Hex, which prevents Fire Resistance from working."

It appears that an Apostle doesn't possess too much blood and only by slaying them can a sizeable amount be extracted. When slain, the storm will ebb and the meteors will stop falling."
