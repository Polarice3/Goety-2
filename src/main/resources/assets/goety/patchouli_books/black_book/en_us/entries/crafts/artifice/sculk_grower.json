Unlike the Sculk Converter, it will remain active with a constant Redstone signal, and it absorbs Soul Energy in bulk rather than slowly siphoning it. When it absorbs a bulk of Soul Energy, it gains 'Charges' which is used to speed up the growth of the surrounding crops."

If not supplied with Redstone, the Grower will still grow crops until it runs out of Charges. If there aren't any crops around the Grower(Or the Continuous Growth Config is disabled), its Charges will decay within itself."
